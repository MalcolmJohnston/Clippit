# Introduction
Welcome to Clippit library usage guide. If you don't know what Clippit is - please check [Home Page](/).

Please check navigation on the left â¬… for more articles.

### Requirements
Clippit library should work with any framework version supported by [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/net-standard) or greater. However, it is guaranteed only with .NET 5 and up - I did not test .NET Framework, Mono, Xamarin or Unity.
